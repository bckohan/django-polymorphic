## Installation

### Install Just

We provide a platform independent justfile with recipes for all the development tasks. You should [install just](https://just.systems/man/en/installation.html) if it is not on your system already.

[django-polymorphic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-polymorphic) uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for environment, package, and dependency management. ``just setup`` will install the necessary build tooling if you do not already have it:

 ```bash
just setup
```

Setup also may take a python version:

```bash
just setup 3.12
```

If you already have uv and python installed running install will just install the development dependencies:

 ```bash
just install
```

**To run pre-commit checks you will have to install just.**

## Documentation

`django-polymorphic` documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) with the [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme. Any new feature PRs must provide updated documentation for the features added. To build the docs run doc8 to check for formatting issues then run Sphinx:

```bash
just install-docs # install the doc dependencies
just docs  # builds docs
just check-docs  # lint the docs
just check-docs-links  # check for broken links in the docs
```

Run the docs with auto rebuild using:

```bash
just docs-live
```

## Static Analysis

`django-polymorphic` uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for Python linting, header import standardization and code formatting. Before any PR is accepted the following must be run, and static analysis tools should not produce any errors or warnings. Disabling certain errors or warnings where justified is acceptable:

To fix formatting and linting problems that are fixable run:

```bash
just fix
```

To run all static analysis without automated fixing you can run:

```bash
just check
```

To format source files you can run:

```bash
just format
```

## Running Tests

`django-polymorphic` is set up to use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) to run unit tests. All the tests are housed in `src/polymorphic/tests`. Before a PR is accepted, all tests must be passing and the code coverage must be at 100%. A small number of exempted error handling branches are acceptable.

To run the full suite:

 ```bash
just test
```

To run a single test, or group of tests in a class:

 ```bash
just test <path_to_tests_file>::ClassName::FunctionName
```

For instance, to run all admin tests, and then just the test_admin_registration test you would do:

 ```bash
just test src/polymorphic/tests/test_admin.py
just test src/polymorphic/tests/test_admin.py::PolymorphicAdminTests::test_admin_registration
```

## Versioning

[django-polymorphic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-polymorphic) strictly adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Issuing Releases

The release workflow is triggered by tag creation. You must have [git tag signing enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). Our justfile has a release shortcut:

```bash
just release x.x.x
```
